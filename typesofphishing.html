    <h2>1. Spear phishing</h2>
    <p>Spear phishing involves targeting a specific individual in an organization to try to steal their credentials. The attacker often first gathers information about the person before starting the attack, such as their name, position, and contact details.</p>
   <h2>2. Watering hole phishing</h2> 
   <p>In a watering hole phishing attack, a hacker figures out a site a group of users tends to visit. They then use it to infect the computers of the users in an attempt to penetrate the network.</p> 
    <h2>3. Evil twin phishing</h2>
    <p>In an evil twin attack, the hacker sets up a false Wi-Fi network that looks real. If someone logs in to it and enters sensitive details, the hacker captures their info.</p>
    <h2>4. Pop-up phishing</h2>
    <p>Pop-up phishing often uses a pop-up about a problem with the security of your computer or some other issue to trick you into clicking. You are then directed to download a file, which ends up being malware, or to call what is supposed to be a support center.</p>
   <h2>5. HTTPS phishing</h2> 
   <p>An HTTPS phishing attack is carried out by sending the victim an email with a link to a fake website. The site may then be used to fool the victim into entering their private information.</p>
   <h2>6. Email phishing</h2> 
    <p>In an email phishing scam, the attacker sends an email that looks legitimate, designed to trick the recipient into entering information in reply or on a site that the hacker can use to steal or sell their data.</p>
